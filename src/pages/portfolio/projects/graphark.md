**Graphark** is a real time rendered math graphing calculator. It takes as input an equation such as `x` or `sin(x)` or even multiple comma-separated functions like `x,x^x,cos(x)` and renders it in an interactible graph that you can zoom and pan.

Developed using **C++23** and **OpenGL**.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Graph multiple function simultaneously
- Zoom and pan
- Customizable shaders

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies used

- C++23
- OpenGL
- CMake
- Vcpkg

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Graphark started as a way for me to get comfortable with the OpenGL API in a straightforward setting. By focusing only on 2D rendering and using an orthographic view, I simplified the process and avoided the added complexity of projection matrices.
