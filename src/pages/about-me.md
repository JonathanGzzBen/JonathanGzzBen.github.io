I was first drawn to programming because I wanted to understand how things really worked ‚Äúunder the hood.‚Äù That curiosity led me to explore C and C++, where I discovered the balance between efficiency, performance, and reliability. Over time, I expanded my skills into other languages like Go, C#, SQL, and Python, always looking for opportunities to learn how different technologies approach problem-solving.

## My Beginnings in Programming üñ•Ô∏è

In 2014, I entered high school and decided to take the Programming Technician career. In the first semester, as an integral project, I knew I wanted to make a video game, so I committed to doing it. I learned to use **Unity**, delved deeper into **Blender**, and a bit into **C#**. It was an arduous process, as no one on my team knew how to program, but with their help, we all learned a bit more and managed to complete the project. We delivered a functional demo of a character in a scenario in our 3D _survival_ type game. It was at that moment that I discovered that making a video game is not easy at all and understood the magnitude of knowledge, time, and dedication needed.

I felt good about having achieved that small project, but gradually I fell more in love with web design and development. So, I started learning more about **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I spent all my free time watching courses and practicing on fictional sites that I designed.

## Professionally ü§ñ

Professionally, I began my career at Banregio, where I worked as an Analyst Programmer focusing on high-performance backend systems for financial transactions. My role gave me exposure to mission-critical environments where efficiency, robustness, and attention to detail weren‚Äôt optional ‚Äî they were requirements. I contributed to payment systems that communicated with Visa and Prosa, and I even helped the company achieve Visa certifications. Beyond core development, I also designed and built tools in C++ to help the Application Support team, reducing incident resolution times in production.

## Programming as a Hobby üí°

Outside of work, I‚Äôve continued pursuing my interest in systems programming, graphics, and optimization. I enjoy experimenting with low-level technologies, from building small operating system components to creating rendering projects with OpenGL. These side projects allow me to merge my love for problem-solving with my curiosity for how computers function at their deepest levels.

## Today üé§

Today, I‚Äôm focused on growing as a backend and systems engineer, exploring opportunities where I can contribute to building scalable, efficient, and reliable solutions. At the same time, I enjoy mentoring and sharing knowledge, since I believe strong teams grow from collaboration and continuous improvement.

### Some of My Videos üé¨

I also have a Youtuber facet, so I've made some videos and hope I can create more once I feel more confident I have the capability to provide continous videos.

## What's Next... üöÄ

I have started my own indie videogames development studio, **NitoriWorks**. We are working towards our first demo.

On the side I'm studying and working to develop my own Operating System.


## A Bit More About Me ‚òï

Today, in 2025, I work at **_FIS_**, a transnational company where I mainly develop financial systems for clients across many regions. I use my spare time to either work on my own personal projects/study or collaborate with the first project we have in my indie studio, **_NitoriWorks_**.

I'm also passionate about writing and drumming so every day I practice or study a bit of both.

I'm **Jonathan Gonzalez Benavides**, and I thank you for reading this.
